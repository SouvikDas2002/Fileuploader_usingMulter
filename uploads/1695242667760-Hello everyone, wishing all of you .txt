Hello everyone, greeting all of you a great day.
So in last class everyone we got a topic for delivery speech and
I got a topic also that is according to me who is better player between The god of cricket Sachin Tendulkar and King of 20s cricket team Viral kholi.
so as both two are legends in history of indian cricket they have l ueft an indelible mark on the sport.
they both have achived remarkable success and have their own distinct styles and contribution to the game.
In comparison I can say that Sachin is revered for his class records and virat is known for his aggresive and modern approach to the game.

so in conclusion I can say that they both are legends in their own right and comparing them is a matter of personal preference,
and both have unique places in their era in cricket history.
