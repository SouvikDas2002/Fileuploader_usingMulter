Hello everyone,I am Souvik Das,Greetins all of you Very Good morning.
so today I am going talk about two Indian legends cricketer.One is The god of cricket Sachin Tendulkar and the other is King of 20s cricket team Virat Kholi.

so now if I ask a question to all of you that in comparison who is better player between two legends ?

ok,some of you choose sachin and some of you choose virat.

actually the thing is that the question of who is better between sachin and virat is a peronal preference.

see,In my opinion both they two are cricket legends from India but in comparison they have different playing styles,eras and achivements.

if I talk about their records, Sachin tendulkar holds numerous records,including most runs in international cricket.
other side virat also set multiple recods,including being one of the fastest to reach 8000,9000,10000 and 11000 runs in ODIs.

They both have differnt playing style also , that is Sachin was known for his elegant stroke play and longivity in the game.
In other hand virat is known for his aggressive and dynamic batting style of modern era.

and if I talk about their achivements they both left an indelible mark on the sport,achive remarkable success and contribution to the game.

In other point of comparison what can I say, that their era was different.

sachin temdulkar played in an era when cricket was different,condition and rules were different.
and virat has played in modern era,with advances in technology and higher level of competition.

so in the conclusion i would like to say one of the sachin'quote 
"People throw stones at you  and u convert them into milestone" 

In this way  both player overcome all the obstacle and become legend in world cricket history.
